    "instruction": "You are a professional business analyst who specializes in analyzing software requirements to define a software product line (SPL) feature model. You are aware that there are six possible types of constraints in a SPL feature model, encompassing mandatory, optional, or, xor, require and exclude. “mandatory” applies for individual mandatory features. “optional” applies for individual optional features. “or” applies for one-to-many constraints where at least one child feature must be present but two or more can coexist when a parent feature is present. “xor” applies for one-to-many constraints where child features coexist in a mutually exclusive way when a parent feature is present. “require” applies for two disconnected features that depend on each other. “exclude” applies for two disconnected features that are mutually exclusive. Please generate a SPL feature model based on the following software requirements:The system also enables the inhabitants to visualize and control the status of the devices from a common user interface. Access control to some rooms may be required. The inhabitants can be authenticated by means of a PIN introduced in a keypad, passing an identification card by a card reader, or touching a fingerprint reader.  Inhabitants must be able to adjust the heater of the house to their preferred value.  Heaters can be in Celsius or in Fahrenheit. Additionally, heater control will adjust itself automatically to save energy. The daily schedule of each inhabitant is stored in the Smart Home gateway. In the periods of the day when the house is empty, the heater is disconnected and reconnected with enough time to reach the desired temperature when the inhabitants come back home. If a window is opened or closed, the heater control will take it into account to adjust itself. If the opening of a window would suppose a high energy consumption, because, for instance, the heater is trying to increase the room temperature and it is too cold outside, the inhabitants will be notified through the GUI.  Also, the Smart Home could choose to open or close windows to regulate the temperature inside the house. There are different types of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These can be touch screens inside the house, mobile phones, or through a website available in the internet.  These interfaces allow monitoring and managing the different devices of the smart home. Inhabitants must be able to switch on/off and adjust the intensity of the different lights placed in a room. The adjustment can be performed specifying an intensity value or selecting a predefined value according to the current activities performed by the inhabitants, such as: watching TV, reading, sleeping, or during a night party. Besides, lights will be automatically switched on/off depending on several factors. If there is not natural light outside the house, the lights will be automatically switched on. Each time an inhabitant enters a room where there is not illumination enough, lights are automatically switched on, unless the room is in sleep mode which means that the inhabitants in the room may be sleeping. Presence simulation is activated when the inhabitants are in vacations or out of the house for long periods of time. This performs actions at certain times each day to give the impression that somebody is at home. The actions, like switching on and off lights or music, or opening and closing the blinds, can be determined by the inhabitants and are executed automatically. Fire control is responsible for identifying the presence of fire or smoke inside the home. When the Smart Home identifies a possible fire occurrence (based on smoke or temperature elevation), it emits an alarm, turns on the sprinklers, notifies the inhabitant through all the installed GUIs, and also sends an alarm to the fire department and/or other emergency group.  Finally, the system unlocks all doors and windows.  .",

    "instruction": "You are a professional business analyst who specializes in analyzing software requirements to define a software product line (SPL) feature model. You are aware that there are six possible types of constraints in a SPL feature model, encompassing mandatory, optional, or, xor, require and exclude. “mandatory” applies for individual mandatory features. “optional” applies for individual optional features. “or” applies for one-to-many constraints where at least one child feature must be present but two or more can coexist when a parent feature is present. “xor” applies for one-to-many constraints where child features coexist in a mutually exclusive way when a parent feature is present. “require” applies for two disconnected features that depend on each other. “exclude” applies for two disconnected features that are mutually exclusive. Please generate a SPL feature model based on the following software requirements:When a user opens Picasa, it simply looks at the folders on his computer and displays the photos it finds. Picasa displays the file types that the user defined, in the folders he selected.#W2 When using editing tools in Picasa, the original files are never touched. The photo edits the user makes are only viewable in Picasa until he decides to save the changes. Then, Picasa creates a new version of the photo with the edits applied by the user, leaving the original file totally preserved.#W3 Picasa Web Albums provides 1GB of free storage to upload photos.#W4 The user can decide what photos Picasa displays. Picasa shows the user the photo and video file types and folders that he can select to display.#W5 A user can import photos into Picasa from many sources, including cameras, CDs, memory cards, scanners, webcams, and more. The imported photos are saved on the user's computer and displayed automatically in Picasa.#W6 To import photos from many sources the user should click Import, select the source of the new photos from the 'Import photos from' drop-down menu at the top. Then the user selects the destination folder on his computer for the new photos, from the 'Import to' drop-down menu at the bottom. He selects the specific photos to import and clicks the Import or 'Import All' button to import all the photos displayed.#W7 When a user likes to import the uploaded photos to Picasa Web Albums, the user should select the 'Upload' checkbox during the import action.#W8 Picasa supports organizing photos using three collections: Folders collection, Albums and People's collection.#W9 Picasa's Folders collection represents the folders on the user's computer. The user controls the folders that are scanned and displayed by Picasa. #W10 If a user makes changes to folders in Picasa, Picasa affect the corresponding folders on the user's computer hard drive. #W11 Unlike folders, albums exist only in Picasa. A user can create albums using virtual groups of photos taken from multiple folders on the computer. Picasa displays those photos without actually moving them, it's like a playlist for photos. #W12 When a user deletes or moves photos from an album, the original files remain in their original folders on the computer.#W13 A user can organize photos by the people in them. Picasa uses facial recognition technology to find and group similar faces together across the entire collection of photos. #W14 When a user adds name tags to groups of faces, Picasa creates new people albums.#W15 A user can click the Email button in Picasa to quickly email selected photos to friends and family.#W16 Picasa provides a variety of fixes and effects to improve almost any photo or to create something totally unique. #W17 A user can make simple edits, such as cropping, straightening, removing redeye, retouching blemishes, or adding text to your photos.#W18 A user can click on 'I'm Feeling Lucky' to try Picasa's all-in-one lighting and contrast fix. #W19 Picasa allows tuning photos. A user can use the sliders to adjust the color and lighting aspects of photos to produce more visually enhanced images. #W20 Picasa provides 12 effects to make the photos more interesting: Sharpen, convert to sepia or black and white, warm the photo, apply tint, saturate the colors, and more.#W21 Picasa provides advanced photo's editing effects such as Vignette, Orton-ish, Cross Process, and Comic Book etc.#W22 Picasa does not store the photos on the user's computer.#W23 Picasa always preserves the user's original photos. When a user uses the editing tools in Picasa, the original files are never touched. The edits of photos a user makes are only viewable in Picasa until he decides to save the changes. Even then, Picasa creates a new version of the photo with the edits applied, leaving the original file totally preserved.#W24 A user can control over whether his uploaded and Auto backup photos are stored at standard size, which is great for sharing on the web, or full size print quality, which uses more storage space. #W25 A user can upload an unlimited amount of standard size photos, but full size photos will be counted against his Google Drive storage quota.#W26 When a user opens Picasa Web Albums at https://picasaweb.google.com, Picasa displays the user's homepage, and show photos that are interesting to him.#W27 Picasa can present to a user his recent Albums. A user can see more than the latest albums he has uploaded, he can expand the list by clicking Show More Albums. The link of 'View All Albums' will take the user to a gallery of all his albums.#W28 Picasa can present to a user his recent activities. A user can Keep up with the most recently uploaded public albums from people he follow and any photos that have been shared with him.#W29 Picasa displays to user featured Photos. A user can view high quality photos from across the Picasa Community by clicking an individual photo to view it full size. #W30 Photos that have been featured will be badged with the Picasa Web Albums logo.#W31 Picasa allows sharing photos with others. A user can click the Share button to post photos to his Google+ stream or to send an email to a friend, inviting them to look through your Picasa Web album. #W32 A user can set his album visibility as public or as private as he'd like.#W33 Anyone on the web can view public albums. Public albums can be found on the user's public gallery, in web search results, on the user's Google profile, and in Google+.#W34 Picasa supports Limited Albums with a link. Those albums are visible to anyone with the link. They're technically visible to anyone but they include a unique authorization key in the web address. The key is a combination of letters and numbers that make the address difficult to guess.#W35 Limited albums are visible only to the people a user specifies, and those people must sign in to their Google Account to view the photos. Users without a Google Account will be prompted to create one. #W36 Google+ users have permission to re-share an album that was shared with them. #W37 Users within Google+, are able to see who else shared with his followers.#W38 Picasa supports 'Only you albums', which is the highest level of privacy. These albums are visible only to you. Changing an album to an 'Only you' type will wipe everyone off the album's 'Shared with' list.#W39 Picasa Web Albums is as social as the user wants it to be. #W40 A user can add users to the list of people he's following to receive updates when they add new photos to their public galleries. #W41 A user can add captions to all photos in an album from the same screen#W42 When uploading photos from the Picasa software, all photo captions will be uploaded with the user's photos. There is a 1024-character limit for captions displayed in Picasa Web Albums. Therefore captions longer than 1024 characters will be truncated appropriately for display in Picasa Web Albums.#W43 Changes made to captions in Picasa can automatically be reflected in the user's online albums by enabling Sync to Web in Picasa.#W44 A user can also manually prompt his captions created and edited in Picasa Web Albums to be synced down to his photos in Picasa. #W45 A user applies tags to label photos so that he and his friends can easily locate specific photos when searching on Picasa Web Albums. #W46 When a user uploads photos, any existing geographical information that is included in the photo EXIF data will be used to automatically map the photos.#W47 Users can drag-and-drop assigning map locations for albums and individual photos in Picasa Web Albums. #W48 Picasa supports 'Embedding photos on other sites'. A user can include a Picasa Web Albums slideshow, album, or image on his blog or website. The user needs to copy a small snippet of HTML and paste it in the source code of his site. This option is applicable to albums with visibilities set to be 'Public' or 'Limited, anyone with the link.'#W49 Picasa supports syncing changes. When a user enables the Sync to Web option in Picasa for a folder or album, edits made to his photos in Picasa are reflected immediately in the corresponding album in Picasa Web Albums.#W50 Once a user enables the Sync to Web feature, he can sync the following changes from Picasa to your web albums: Photos edit, addition or deletion, Addition of captions, tags or geotags, name tags and the order of photos.#W51 Once a user reaches his storage limit, any new photos he uploads, using sync to web that exceeds the size limit, will be automatically resized.#W52 When Sync to Web is enabled, changes made by user will only be synchronized in one direction, from Picasa to his web albums. However, the user can update captions, tags, and geo-tags from your web albums to Picasa using Refresh Online Status.#W53 A user can specify whether others can reproduce or share his work using Creative Commons licensing feature.#W54 When a user uploads photos to his accounts with Google products, Picasa automatically added the photos to his Picasa Web Albums account as well..",

You are aware that there are six possible types of constraints in a SPL feature model, encompassing mandatory, optional, or, xor, require and exclude. “mandatory” applies for individual mandatory features. “optional” applies for individual optional features. “or” applies for one-to-many constraints where at least one child feature must be present but two or more can coexist when a parent feature is present. “xor” applies for one-to-many constraints where child features coexist in a mutually exclusive way when a parent feature is present. “require” applies for two disconnected features that depend on each other. “exclude” applies for two disconnected features that are mutually exclusive. Please generate a SPL feature model based on the following software requirements:The software must allow input of patient data from the patient and the Physician.#4.1.1.1 A web-based system can allow initial patient information to be gathered by a dumb terminal in office or from patient own computer upon Email appointment verification hyperlinked to input screen.#4.1.2 The software must request username and password for access to data, only after authentication the system will allow access.  #4.1.3 The software must require high levels of error correction and input validation.#4.1.3.1 Message box prompts would require a second entry of key data fields including name, DOB, Social Security Number, medications and allergies. Doctor inputs will similarly prompt proper code sets for diagnosis.#4.1.4 The software must allow browsing by the physician of historical medical information of his/her patients only.#4.1.5 The software must identify the patient by a unique numeric identifier derived from a function performed on the patient birth date. #4.1.5.1 Algorithm will be simply TODAY-BIRTHDAY = NUM & Doctor Key & Increment (Increment will be added if duplicate number found in Database.) #4.1.6 The software must retrieve, update, and store data from multiple input locations including but not limited to hospital workstations, physician workstations, inbound emergency vehicles, and the electronic monitoring equipment.#4.1.7 The software must allow patient to view their own medical record online allowing changes only to address, Insurance and phone number.#4.1.8 The software must only allow deletions by the vendor and only after archiving data.#4.1.9 The software to be developed must display the correct patient name.#4.1.10 The software to be developed shall display the correct time of day in compliance with ISO 8601. #4.1.11 The software to be developed must operate twenty-four hours a day.#4.1.12 The software must allow full and complete record search queries by physicians; also allow access to limited bloodwork, medication, and allergen information by EMT personnel and display results in order specified by operator.#4.1.13 The software must allow input of diagnostic imagery and FAT32 compression for storage and transmission of data.#4.1.14 The software must enable out put of real-time data and imagery from electronic diagnostic equipment through java applets which run in the web browser.#4.1.14.1 Nurses at workstation or doctors at desktop can access this data. #4.1.15 The software must retrieve and sort medical record information and allow for screen and print output of said information.#4.1.15.1 Print output will include name, DOB, and requested diagnostic information only.#4.1.16 The software must encrypt the data using Rijndael (AES) encryption algorithms from the database for transmission from point to point.#4.2.1 The software interface must follow design conventions which allow for familiar location of drop down menus, help etc. #4.2.2 Input errors will be returned in red with appropriate message box.#4.2.3 More than three attempts at login and failure will produce a red flag to system administrator.#4.3.1 The Hospital software should be able to support up to 300 simultaneous users.#4.3.2The Hospital software should support an internet server, diagnostics inputs (see section 5.1), thirty two terminals and a SQL server database.#4.3.3 95% of the transactions shall be processed in less than one second.#4.3.4 Data should be secured and backed up every quarter hour.#4.3.5 Power supply should have a back up and a disaster recovery plan.#4.3.6 System should be operable 24 hours a day and accessible in real-time.#4.3.7 Secure Socket Layer 3.0 with 128 bit encryption will enable network security#4.3.8 Hardware, software, and data communication elements must be sourced within budgetary constraints..",

A suitable registration page or pages should be provided.#7New users must go thru a verification process (TBD) to confirm their email address before their account is activated in the system.#8Once verified, users must be able to log in to the portal.#9Users must be able to change their password (but not their user name/ID).#10There must be a way for users to retrieve a lost password.#11Users must be able to log out. There must be a session timeout mechanism that will automatically log the user out after a period of time (period TBD).#12On logout, the contents of user’s Select List and Cart are cleared. The contents of the Reserved List is preserved.#13Users must be able to search for eBooks.#14The system should provide interfaces for both “simple” and “advanced” searches:#14.1 “simple” should be a search on any one of fields Author, Title, or ISBN.#14.2“advanced” should provide an easy way to construct complex searches on multiple fields with different logic (e.g. AND, OR, NOT)#15The system should provide several “quick search” options:#15.1Newest eBooks – returns a listing of the 10- 50 (configurable) most recently added eBooks#15.2Top 20 Titles – returns a listing of the  20 most frequently borrowed eBooks#15.2.1 The actual number should be configurable by an administrator#15.2.2 The UI should provide a pick list of values: 10, 20, 25, 50, 100#15.3Latest Returns – returns a list of 10-50 (configurable) most recently checked-in eBooks#15.3.1Either explicitly checked in by a patron, or lending period expired freeing the eBook for loan#15.3.2eBooks listed in this set must not have any reservations… must be available for immediate loan#16Users must be able to browse the eBooks in the catalog.#17Users must be able to select how they want to browse:#17.1Browse by Author#17.1.1Must be able to select an alphabetical subset… e.g. author names beginning with A, or M for example#17.2Browse by Title#17.2.1Must be able to select an alphabetical subset… e.g. author names beginning with A, or M for example#17.3Browse by genre (e.g. fiction, non-fiction, science fiction, etc.)#18Users should be able to browse by Publisher.#19Users should be able to browse by Book Award.#20Users should be able to browse according to a combination of data, such as by Author + Genre, Title + Year of Publication, Author + Book Award, etc. #21The Select List is similar to a shopping cart except that the checkout processes a loan of the eBooks in the list rather than a purchase.#21.1Each user must be able to save a list of eBooks they want to borrow – their “Select List”#21.2The Select List is only for the current session and is cleared when the session terminates#21.3Each eBook added to the Select List remains in the list for 20 minutes. During this time, the number of copies available for loan is reduced by 1 and the number available is shown to other users. #21.3.1If the time expires and the eBook is removed from the Select List, then the number of copies available for loan is increased by 1 and the number available is shown to other users.#21.4The number of eBooks user may add to their Select List is limited to the checkout limit defined in the system configuration minus  the number of eBooks patron has currently checked out. #21.4.1If user currently has the maximum number checked out, then all Add to Select List links should be disabled for that user.#21.5If all copies allowable under the eBook’s DRM are currently on loan to other users, then the eBook cannot be added to any user’s Select List (the UI widget is disabled) and the UI must inform the user that no copy is currently available for loan.#22User should be able to navigate to Check Out any time via a readily visible link or button.#23The checkout page must display the eBooks in the user’s Select List.#24The user must be able to remove eBooks from the Select List at this point.#25Via an appropriate UI widget, user should be able to execute check out which processes on all the eBooks left on the Select List.#26When checkout is complete, user must be presented with a page of the checked out titles, each title having a DOWNLOAD widget.  Clicking the widget downloads a copy of the eBook with appropriate DRM applied. #27Each checked out eBook should remain listed on the user’s Downloads page until the loan period expires. #28Users must be able to “return” any eBook on their Downloads page that has not yet been downloaded via an appropriate “RETURN THIS EBOOK” widget.#29Executing the return must remove the eBook from the user’s downloads page, decreases the count of eBooks the user currently has checked out (if that value is greater than zero), and increases by 1 the number of copies of the eBook available for loan..",
